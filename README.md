# My First Portfolio

## Description
The aim of this project was to create a portfolio that would display my projects and skills publicly, whilst also providing information about me and how to reach me.   

## Usage
The portfolio's use is to display all of my projects in one webpage and continuously update the portfolio each time that I create or amend a previous project. It will be used to show my progress as I become more experienced with Web Development and coding. It also allows me to showcase my skills, and will enable me to track my growth throughout time. An additional benefit of a porfolio is that others can view my work and find out about me and my work.
