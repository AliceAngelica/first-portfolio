      <h2>About Me...<br>
        My name is Alice, and this is my cat Shadow! </h2>

      <p class="p-about">My name is Alice Angelica Katinas, I was born in Shoreditch, Central London in the ninties
        where
        I lived for 19 years. Three generations of my family had grown up in the same area, including my Nan throughout
        World
        War 2. She even went to the same primary school as me which was bombed during the war and rebuilt again. I have
        since
        lived in various areas of London, before relocating to Buckinghamshire in 2020. I am
        mixed-race with my grandad being from Trinidad and Tobago. I also have a six-year-old fluffy Maine Coon cat
        called Shadow.
        <br>
        I love baking! (and cooking) It is one of my favorite things to do, I love making all kinds of deserts such as
        tarts, cakes,
        bread, ice-cream, puddings, mousse, biscuits! I make really good pastry too, especially shortbread pastry, my
        Quiche is so so good!! Aside from baking I enjoy travelling, riding my bicycle and reading. I'm a big fan of
        psychology
        and health, and I love expanding my knowledge of these topics in my spare time.
      </p>

      <p class="p-about" id="cv">I studied IT in college, but once college had finished I decided that I want to study
        Psychology at University instead of IT. I did enjoy IT but at the time I was much more interested in Psychology
        and
        very curious to learn. I ended up getting my Honours degreee in Psychology which I am very proud of. I managed
        to get
        a top grade for my dissertation which I put a lot of hard work into.
        <br>
        After University I worked in Marketing for a few years. I am still interested in pursuing a career in Psychology
        but
        perhaps later in life. Since being in school I have always found the idea of designing webpages fascinating, but
        I
        had always assumed that it would be too complicated for me. However, during the summer of 2022 I stumbled upon
        an online
        coding course then decided to look into Web Development. It has since peaked my interest and I have
        decided that
        I would love a tech career. I have been enjoying learning how to code so far!

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1 <br> A Coding refactor of the marketing company Horiseon.</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/AliceAngelica/first-portfolio"><img src="../first-portfolio/images/work1.png"
            id="project1"></img></a>
        <p class="work-p">The aim of the project was to refactor the code of the Horiseon
          Marketing website without interfering with the styling of the page. The refactor aimed to increase the
          accessibility of the page for those with a disability or visual impairment, and to improve the readability of
          the code. To increase the accessibility of the code non-semantic HTML (such as div tags) were replaced with
          semantic
          HTML elements, this enables individuals using a screen reader (or other equipment) to navigate through the
          various sections
          of the page without difficulty. Images were also provided with descriptions. The readability was improved by
          removing unnecessary and repetitive
          CSS selectors. Comments were also included throughout the HTML and CSS documents, making the code easier to
          understand. </p>
