# My First Portfolio

## Description
The aim of the project was to create a portfolio that would display my projects and skills publicly, whilst also providing information about me.   

## Usage
The portfolio's use is to continuously update the portfolio each time that I create a new project or amend a previous project. Its purpose is to continue to expand as I become more experienced with Web Development. It also allows me to showcase my skills, and will enable me to track my growth throughout time. An additional benefit of a porfolio is that others can view my work and find out about me.
