      <h2>About Me...<br>
        My name is Alice, and this is my cat Shadow! </h2>

      <p class="p-about">My name is Alice Angelica Katinas, I was born in Shoreditch, Central London in the ninties
        where
        I lived for 19 years. Three generations of my family had grown up in the same area, including my Nan throughout
        World
        War 2. She even went to the same primary school as me which was bombed during the war and rebuilt again. I am
        mixed-race (even though I don't looked mixed)
        as my grandad is from Trinidad and Tobago.
        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there
        live the blind
        texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
        small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
        paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing
        has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
        text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not
        to
        do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
        Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the
        way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
        hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
        Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1 <br> A Coding refactor of the marketing company Horiseon.</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/AliceAngelica/first-portfolio"><img src="../first-portfolio/images/work1.png"
            id="project1"></img></a>
        <p class="work-p">The aim of the project was to refactor the code of the Horiseon
          Marketing website without interfering with the styling of the page. The refactor aimed to increase the
          accessibility of the page for those with a disability or visual impairment, and to improve the readability of
          the code. To increase the accessibility of the code non-semantic HTML (such as div tags) were replaced with
          semantic
          HTML elements, this enables individuals using a screen reader (or other equipment) to navigate through the
          various sections
          of the page without difficulty. Images were also provided with descriptions. The readability was improved by
          removing unnecessary and repetitive
          CSS selectors. Comments were also included throughout the HTML and CSS documents, making the code easier to
          understand. </p>
